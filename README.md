# Water Mapping using Satellite Imagery
Accurately detecting and segmenting waterbodies (rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and oceans) from satellite imagery is essential for effective environmental monitoring, water resource management, and disaster mitigation.

This notebook focuses on building a deep learning based U-Net model to automate waterbody segmentation. The goal is to enable fast, reliable, and scalable identification of water regions within satellite images, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

## Dataset: Images and Masks of Satellite Images of Water Bodies for Image Segmentation
It's a collection of water bodies images captured by the Sentinel-2 Satellite. Each image comes with a black and white mask where white represents water and black represents something else but water. The masks were generated by calculating the NWDI (Normalized Water Difference Index) which is frequently used to detect and measure vegetation in satellite images, but a greater threshold was used to detect water bodies.
